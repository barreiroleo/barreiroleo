# Hello there! 👋

I'm Leo from Argentina 🇦🇷

I'm an electromechanical engineer, experienced in embedded systems for Oil and Gas, gaming, and autonomous driving vehicles.

A nerd who loves engineering, Linux, Neovim, spending time with my family and dogs, playing guitar... You know, the good life.

## Quickly resume
- I started my career as a freelance doing some embedded systems for Oil and Gas projects for a couple of years.
  - C and C++ for bare metal, Python scripting, PCB design tools.
  - _Well, I'm skipping a lot of projects as a freelancer_
- I've worked at Globant as a Senior C++ Developer doing some backend systems for Madden 24 and Madden 25, one of the biggest franchises from EA Sports ([Moby ID 1464937](https://www.mobygames.com/person/1464937)).
  - Frostbite engine, gRPC services, some scripting tools, and try to guess... C++, a lot of C++.
- Then I did some stuff for the automotive industry (autonomous driving) at Spyrosoft, for one of the top AI and graphics technology companies. You can imagine which one.
  - Co-leading a Software Quality and Optimization team for planning and control modules.
  - Performance analysis, hotspots mitigations, exceptions burndown, safety, etc.
  - Guess what... C++, C++ everywhere (and some AUTOSAR / MISRA PTSD).
