# Hello there! 👋

I'm Leo from Argentina 🇦🇷

Electromechanical engineer experienced on embedded systems and software. I love to bridge hardware, firmware, and product execution to turn complex systems into simple, clear, and reliable solutions.

I'm experienced in embedded systems, autonomous driving vehicles, and backend for AAA games.

A nerd who loves engineering, Linux, Neovim, spending time with my family and dogs, playing guitar... You know, the good life.

## Quickly resume
- I started my career as a freelance doing some embedded systems for Oil and Gas projects for a couple of years.
  - C and C++ for bare metal, Python scripting, PCB design tools.
  - _Well, I'm skipping a lot of projects as a freelancer_
- I've worked at Globant as a Senior C++ Developer doing some backend systems for Madden 24 and Madden 25, one of the biggest franchises from EA Sports ([Moby ID 1464937](https://www.mobygames.com/person/1464937)).
  - Frostbite engine, gRPC services, some scripting tools, and try to guess... C++, a lot of C++.
- Then I did some stuff for the automotive industry (autonomous driving) at Spyrosoft, for one of the top AI and graphics technology companies. You can imagine which one.
  - Co-leading a Software Quality and Optimization team for planning and control modules.
  - Performance analysis, hotspots mitigations, exceptions burndown, safety, etc.
  - Guess what... C++, C++ everywhere (and some AUTOSAR / MISRA PTSD).
